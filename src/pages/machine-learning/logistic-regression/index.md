## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

## Logistic Regression Assumptions
Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.
For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.
Only the meaningful variables should be included.
The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity.
The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.
Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.
